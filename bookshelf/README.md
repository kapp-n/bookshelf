This is the React frontend to my Rack backend project. 
This repository contains all the UI for my personally curated library, or "Bookshelf". With this app you can store your favorite books to shelves organzied by their genre. There are "add shelf", "delete shelf", and "add book" buttons on the main shelves page. "Add book" will trigger a form to fill in the details of your desired book entry. 

On clicking a book entry, you will be taken to that book's page where you can access all the proivded details of the given book, and you will also be able to completely delete that entry with a "delete book" button. 


To Use:
This is a personal project that uses two repositories. This one runs a React frontend and the other runs a Rack backend. Use npm start to run this on your local machine at localhost:3000
